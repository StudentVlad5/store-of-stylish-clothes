A cookie is\n          a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that\n          is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser.\n          The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser\n          requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent”\n          cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a\n          web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless\n          deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the\n          other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web\n          browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information\n          that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we\n          store about you may be linked to the information stored in and\n          obtained from cookies. We use only session cookies on our website. 1.\n          The names of the cookies that we use on our website, and the purposes\n          for which they are used, are set out below: a. we use Google Analytics\n          and Adwords on our website to recognize a computer when a user visits\n          the website / track users as they navigate the website / enable the\n          use of a shopping cart on the website / improve the website’s\n          usability / analyze the use of the website / administer the website /\n          prevent fraud and improve the security of the website / personalize\n          the website for each user / target advertisements which may be of\n          particular interest to specific users / describe purpose(s). 2. Most\n          browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies—for example: a. in\n          Internet Explorer (version 10) you can block cookies using the cookie\n          handling override settings available by clicking “Tools,” “Internet\n          Options,” “Privacy,” and then “Advanced”; b. in Firefox (version 24)\n          you can block all cookies by clicking “Tools,” “Options,” “Privacy,”\n          selecting “Use custom settings for history” from the drop-down menu,\n          and unticking “Accept cookies from sites”; and c. in Chrome (version\n          29), you can block all cookies by accessing the “Customize and\n          control” menu, and clicking “Settings,” “Show advanced settings,” and\n          “Content settings,” and then selecting “Block sites from setting any\n          data” under the “Cookies” heading.
